# Graphics System

This project includes:
 - A simple game engine with a graphics system. The graphics system accomodates both Direct3D and OpenGL with platform-independent interfaces.
 - A Maya plugin to export meshes from Maya to custom-defined JSON mesh representations.
 - A console app to build JSON files into binary files, which can be loaded into C++ instances at runtime, balancing readability and runtime performance.
 - A terrain generation system utilizing the custom graphics system, which procedurally generates terrain based on parameters provided in JSON files.
 - A sample game with input system that showcases the engine systems.
